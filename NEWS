* Version 0.5 ()

  New features:

   - Racket: interaction with submodules (entering them and evaluation
     within their scope).
   - New commands geiser-eval-buffer (C-c C-b) and
     geiser-eval-buffer-and-go (C-c M-b), by Nick Parker.
   - Pressing return on a previous expression in the REPL will resend
     it, by Darren Hoo.
   - Improvements to syntax highlighting (define/match in racket).


  Bug fixes:

   - Autodoc for Guile 2.0.9+'s subr fixed, thanks to Ludovic Courtès.
   - Fixed problem when saving REPL history that contained non-ASCII
     chars: all UTF-8 characters should be fair game now.
   - Fixed problems with geiser-doc's history being handled by
     session.el (by not letting the latter handle it).

  New features:

   - New command geiser-insert-lambda, bound to C-c \ in Scheme
     buffers (thanks to Ray Racine).

     to Diogo F.S. Ramos), via geiser-guile-case-sensitive-p and
     geiser-racket-case-sensitive-pp
   - C-u C-x C-e to insert evaluation result in buffer (thanks to
     Diogo).
   - New flag geiser-repl-query-on-kill-p to control whether emacs
     will ask for confirmation before killing a buffer with a live
     REPL process.

     REPL if one isn't active when geiser-mode is activated.

   - Filename completion should also work in emacs 23.2 now.
   - Racket filenames with spaces no longer break Geiser when entering
     them (thanks to Diogo).
   - The REPL no longer hangs when company-mode is active (thanks to
     Aleix Conchillo).
